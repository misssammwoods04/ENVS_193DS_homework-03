ENVST 193DS homework 3 Spring 2025
## General Information
This repo is for homework 3, which includes visualizations of my personal data. My personal data explores the rate at which I leavel home/campus/Isla Vista given several factors I believe to impact my stress level including homework assignments, social plans, purpose of travel, etc.

This repo is also meant to show my affective visualization of my personal data which I created to be a metaphorical road map. 

My repo also includes a discussion of my statistical critique which I chose to represent the study, "Students’ Willingness to Plant Trees and Pay for Their Maintenance on Campuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo" (https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/22/15148). 

This repo belongs to Sam Woods and I am the only person contributing to it.
