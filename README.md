ENVST 193DS homework 3 Spring 2025
## General Information
This repo is for homework 3, which includes visualizations of my personal data. My personal data explores the rate at which I leavel home/campus/Isla Vista given several factors I believe to impact my stress level including homework assignments, social plans, purpose of travel, etc.
This repo is also meant to show my affective visualization of my personal data which I created to be a metaphorical road map. 
My repo also includes a discussion of my statistical critique which I chose to represent the study, "Studentsâ€™ Willingness to Plant Trees and Pay for Their Maintenance on Campuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo". 

This repo belongs to Sam Woods and I am the only person contributing to it.
