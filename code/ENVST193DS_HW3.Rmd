# Problem 1

## a.         

For each number of assignments I have (0-5), I can find the average rate at which I leave campus based on how many times I have left campus for a certain number of assignments. This comparison would be informative because I believe that my stress level increases with the number of assignments I have, so I think I would be more likely to leave campus on the days that my stress os high.
