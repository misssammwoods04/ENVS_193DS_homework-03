# Problem 1

## a.         

For each number of assignments I have (0-5), I can find the rate at which I leave campus based on how many times I have left campus for a certain number of assignments. This comparison would be informative because I believe that my stress level increases with the number of assignments I have, and I believe that I would be more likely to leave campus on the days that my stress is high. 

## b.
```{r}
 clean_p_data <- p_data |> 
  clean_names()
```


```{r}

ggplot(clean_p_data, aes(x = x_hw_to_do, y = leave_iv_campus_home, color = x_hw_to_do)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0.05, 
              width = 0.2, 
              alpha = 0.4, 
              size = 7,
              pch = 20,
              stroke = 1.5) +
  labs(
    title = " Leaving School vs. Assignments",
    x = "Number of Assignments",
    y = "Did I Leave School? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)"
  ) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "lightgreen", high = "darkblue") +
  theme_minimal()
          
```

## c. 

Data collected from a personal project exploring the question: 'Do I tend to leave school/Isla Vista/home more often when I feel stressed?' Each point represents a daily observation, plotting the number of assignments (as a representation of stress) against whether I left campus/home (1 = Yes, 0 = No). Point colors indicate the number of assignments on that day, ranging from 0 to 5.
